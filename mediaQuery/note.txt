Media queries in CSS are used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, creating responsive designs. They are written with @media followed by conditions like screen width, enabling tailored styling for various screen sizes.



Viewport Meta Tag (Optional):
To ensure proper behavior on mobile devices, you can also add the following viewport meta tag in the HTML

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


1:Basic Syntax:
Media queries start with the @media rule followed by a condition or a set of conditions enclosed in parentheses. Inside the curly braces, you define the styles that should be applied when the conditions are met.

@media (condition) {
    /* Styles for this condition */
}



2:Conditions:
Conditions in media queries are based on various properties such as width, height, orientation, device type, etc. You can use min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height, orientation, screen, print, and more.

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Styles for screens up to 768px wide */
}


3:Combining Conditions:
You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators like and and or (comma).

@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
    /* Styles for screens between 768px and 1024px wide */
}


4:Applying Styles:
Inside the curly braces of the media query, you define the styles that should be applied when the conditions are met. These styles will override the default styles for the specified conditions.
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
}





question: can the media query work without media queries can work without the viewport meta tag?

media queries can work without the viewport meta tag, but using the viewport meta tag is highly recommended for creating a consistent and optimized experience on different devices. The viewport meta tag helps control how your webpage is displayed on mobile devices by setting the initial scale, width, and other properties. Without this tag, your webpage might not behave as expected on various screen sizes and orientations. So while media queries can still apply different styles, using the viewport meta tag enhances the overall responsiveness of your design.
